<h2 align="center">A workspace in motion</h1>

This is not a traditional desktop in any sense. It is a highly opinionated
environment built purely around what works for me, frequently disregarding
standard conventions in favor of personal efficiency and aesthetics.
Rather than a finished product, it is a living project
that constantly evolves alongside my shifting needs.

This setup is tailored for my personal use, so there might be some
hidden quirks I’ve missed. Bug fixes and README polish are always appreciated!
If you’re thinking about adding a new feature, let’s chat about it in
an [issue](https://github.com/envyj020/dotfiles/issues) first to
ensure it aligns with the project direction.
