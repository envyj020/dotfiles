<h2 align="center">🚀 A workspace in motion</h1>

This isn't a traditional desktop. It is a highly opinionated
environment built around my own workflow, frequently disregarding
standard conventions in favor of personal efficiency and aesthetics.
Think of it less as a finished product and more as a constantly
evolving project alongside my shifting needs.

That said, you are more than welcome to explore and cherry-pick whatever you find useful.
Whether it’s a single alias or a full configuration block, feel free to make it yours!

<h2 align="center">🍻 Contribution</h2>

This setup is tailored for my personal use, so there might be some
hidden quirks I’ve missed. Bug fixes and docs polish are always appreciated!
If you’re thinking about adding a new feature, let’s chat about it in
an [issue](https://github.com/envyj020/dotfiles/issues) first to
ensure it aligns with the project direction.
