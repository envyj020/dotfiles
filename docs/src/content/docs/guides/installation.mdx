The installation is an interactive process. Whether using the standalone installer or the manual method,
you will need to provide your own preferences.

<Aside icon="magnifier">
  [GNU Stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow) is used to manage symlinks and
  it might fail to do so if it finds an existing file (like a default .bashrc)
  where it's trying to create a symlink. You may skip this step; otherwise,
  ensure any conflicting files are backed up to a non-standard location before
  re-running any of the outlined methods below.

      The standalone installer may be inspected before use or alternatively
      check out the source code directly on [GitHub](https://github.com/envyj020/dotfiles).

## Post-Installation

Congratulations! You’ve successfully installed everything.
To ensure your workspace looks and behaves correctly after a reboot, please complete these two quick steps:

### 1. Optional - Set your wallpaper

The i3 configuration is hardcoded to look for the wallpaper in a specific location.
While a default wallpaper is provided, you can set your own by overriding the one under `~/Pictures/wallpaper.jpg`.

### 2. Configure your displays

Open your terminal and run the following command once you have your monitors arranged the way you like them:

<Code code="autorandr --save default" lang="sh" />
<Aside title="autorandr">
  `autorandr` was installed as part of the OS baseline. The command above will
  save your monitor setup so i3 will know which settings to apply upon startup.
